          Here is a list of tasks that the admin has set up for you. In order to
          complete each task, you must read each pdf thoroughly and answer the 
          security question. Your answer must be as close as possible to the
          document. Use as many keywords that you find important in order to
          describe the document. Clicking the verify button will result in
          success or failure depending on how good your answer is.
